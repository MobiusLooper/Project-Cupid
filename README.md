## Project Scope

The scope of this project is to use a speed dating dataset obtained from Kaggle to explore and analyse the attributes within pairings of males and females that lead to successful matches, using data obtained from real life speed dating interactions. 

Using this data, we will build a series of predictive models, which aim to predict a successful match between a male and female based on real life interactions. We will communicate the scope of this project using the CRISP methodology (business understanding > data understanding > data preparation > modelling > evaluation > deployment).
